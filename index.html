         <p>
          Also known as the Iron Man of India and Bismarck of India, Sardar
          Vallabh Bhai Patel was known for being very brave and epic from a very
          young age. Initially a lawyer, Sardar Patel left the legal profession
          to fight for India's independence from British control. Following
          India's independence, he was appointed as the country's Deputy Prime
          Minister and worked tirelessly to bring princely states into the Union
          of India. He also received the honorary Bharat Ratna Award for his
          hard work and dedication.

          Popularly known as Chacha Nehru, he adored kids very much and his
          birthday is celebrated as Childres's Day. Nehru, who started out as a
          lawyer, rose to fame as an Indian independence fighter and politician.
          Mahatma Gandhi's attempts to free India from the British had a big
          impact on his fervour for the country's independence. He participated
          in the war for freedom, rose to the position of President of the
          Indian National Congress, and finally was appointed the country's
          first Prime Minister upon independence.

        <p>
          The “Father of Nation”, Mahatma Gandhi earned the name because of his
          great (mahan) deeds like non-violent movements. He married Kasturba
          when he was 13 and studied law in London before travelling to South
          Africa to practice law. There, he was inspired to fight for human
          rights by seeing racial discrimination toward some Indians. Gandhi
          fervently joined the liberation struggle after seeing how India was
          being ruled by Englishmen. Freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi led various
          non-violent protests against the British people in his quest for
          independence, including the "Dandi March" movement, which he took on
          his bare foot to remove the salt tax.

          Satyagraha campaign, the Civil Disobedience movement, and the Quit
          India movement as a silent but active liberation warrior. Being an
          independence freedom fighter he spent a lot of time behind bars. He
          held the office of Home Minister upon India's independence before
          being elected as the second Prime Minister of India in 1964. The most
          popular phrase “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” was coined by him in 1965

          free country's first president, comes in second on the list of the
          most famous freedom fighters in India. He was a fierce advocate for
          Mahatma Gandhi. In 1947, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who served as India's
          first president from 1950 to 1962, saw his goal come true. He was also
          among the first Indian presidents to be elected to two consecutive
          terms. He raised money for Searchlight and Desh during the
          Independence Movement while also contributing articles to these
          periodicals. In 1962, Prasad also received the Bharat Ratna, the

          Subhas Chandra Bose freedom fighter, known as Netaji, was born in
          Orissa. He may have been shaken by the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and
          forced to leave England for India in 1921. He became a member of the
          Indian National Congress and participated in the Civil Disobedience
          Movement. He sought assistance in Germany after becoming dissatisfied
          with Gandhi Ji's Non-Violence Method of Freedom and finally founded
          the Azad Hind Government & Azad Hind Army, now known as Indian
          National Army (INA), where he trained and supervised all freedom

        <p>
          Bhagat Singh was a well-known revolutionary, and a contentious & my
          personal favourite Freedom Fighter for India who eventually died as a
          proud martyr for his nation. He was born in Punjab in a Sikh family of
          independence warriors. Since he was a naturalized citizen, he joined
          the non-Cooperation movement in 1921. To foster patriotism in Punjabi
          youth, he founded the "Naujawan Bharat Sabha." The Chauri-Chaura
          Massacre changed him completely. At the age of 23, he was hung to
          death by British colonizers. His enduring nickname is "Shaheed
          (martyr) Bhagat Singh." Freedom fighter Bhagat Singh popularized the
          term "Inquilab Zindabad", and it eventually became the anthem of the
          Indian independence struggle.

        <p>
          He was the first freedom fighter of the country. Despite being a
          soldier in the British Army, he rebelled when he learned that the
          cartridges the soldiers were given were lubricated with pig fat. For
          the first time, Mangal Pandey inspired Indians by introducing the
          phrase "Maro Firangi Ko." His uprising served as the catalyst for the
          first liberation struggle. He was one of the earliest rebels to
          motivate young Indian soldiers to start the 1857 Great Rebellion,
          Indian Mutiny, also called India's First War of Independence.

          the British camp. In addition to being bold and brave, Nana Sahib was
          a talented administrator who organized and oversaw thousands of Indian
          warriors. He is one among the best freedom fighters of India.
